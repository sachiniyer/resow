## A Short History of How the Project Came to be
  In the fast moving life that many people live today, it is easy to throw away perfectly good resources of all kinds just because the effort of finding the right home is hard or infeasible. From food to housewares, a huge amount of waste occurs for products that are still perfectly able to be reused or redistributed, if only there were a real time solution to connect people with need and those with excess.

  The ***Re-Sow*** project seeks to solve this problem by presenting a solution for people to connect with others nearby to better distribute the great excess that leads to waste that occurs everyday. Re-Sow will allow people with excess resources to post their excess with their location to invite others nearby to take their excess off their hands. This brings a new waste disposal solution into the hands of everyday consumers as they have a sustainable alternative to throwing away useful excess.

  Curious about the title ***Re-Sow***? The name is derived by combining the word ***Resource*** and ***Sow***
